# My-Parrot-Recorder
"My Parrot Recorder" is an app that helps parrot lovers. Everyone who loves parrots can use this app to set up an exclusive training plan for their parrots. The customization of this function can meet the requirements of users. At the same time, it also provides users with a unique recording function to record the moment when the parrot utters the sound. At the same time, the user can watch some related reading information or news about the parrot. I hope every parrot lover can cultivate a parrot of his own.
